Hey, I'm Ollie—a cybersecurity pro and dev diving deep into Zig, Lua, and Neovim. I tinker with low-level programming, build custom tooling, and explore malware analysis.

This blog is where I share insights, experiments, and lessons learned—whether it’s writing an LSP, reverse-engineering binaries, or customizing Neovim for cybersecurity workflows.

If you’re into efficient code, security research, or just making tools work your way, you’re in the right place.


🛠 Languages & Tools: Zig, Lua, Python, YARA, Sigma, Neovim


🔍 Topics: Malware analysis, cybersecurity, tooling, reverse engineering


Let’s break things (responsibly) and build something better.
