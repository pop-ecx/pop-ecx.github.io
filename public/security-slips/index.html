how a sneaky phishing lure got hold of his mailing list. This interesting read made me
reminisce about how, not so long ago, I almost fell for a similar thing, albeit mine was
not so sophisticated.</p><p>January 2nd 2025, 12 p.m EAT, I had just gotten home from a lengthy holiday. Being super
tired I booted up my Latitude to check on a few things. One of the first things I saw was a
github link sent in one of the many cybersecurity pages I follow. It was allegedly a tool
to check on some IoT stuff. I quickly clicked on the link to the github page, git cloned
the code and ran it (wasn&rsquo;t even thinking of one of my many VMs).</p><p>While running the program, It requested for some input (country code). That&rsquo;s where my
paranoid personality woke up and screamed. I quickly ctrl + c&rsquo;d. I had not even checked the
code I was running. I opened the cloned directory. There were only 2 python files,
the main file and like a module file to be imported. &ldquo;Ohh, that&rsquo;s easy. Let me just open it&rdquo;,
I thought to myself. To my shock, the main file was just a single, lengthy line of code, and on
top of that it was obfuscated. Yeah, not a good start. &ldquo;Maybe suspicious&rdquo;, I said to myself.
I spent the next couple of minutes cleaning it up and writing a deobfuscation script. I wasn&rsquo;t
happy with myself. How could I be so dumb? I finally had the actual source code and understood pretty
well what it does. Well, not everything. I still did not understand the import.</p><p>Luckily for me, the obfuscated structure of the import code was similar to the one in main. My deobfuscation
script sufficed pretty well and within no time, I had the import code right in front of me.</p><p>A quick review showed the code did what it was advertized to do, no hidden shenanigans (at least that I know of).
I also ran my endpoint protection software just to be sure (I normally turn it off since I have some sketchy stuff.
Also, I&rsquo;m my own antivirus (o≧▽≦)o).</p><p>The obfuscation threw me off into thinking I actually ran malware but then again I fail to understand why benign code that
is publicly available on github should be obfuscated. Sometimes obfuscated code is benign code.</p><p>Let that be a lesson, the only person who cannot fall for a hack is he who does not use technology. Return to monke :D</p></div></main></body></html>
