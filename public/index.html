In my previous post I talked about how you can use snyk in your editor as you code and even added snyk-ls as a must have. I had a bit of a tough time finding the correct configuration to achieve this using Neovim. Perhaps you are, right now, on the same path as myself last year. Luckily for you, I gotchu.
Before proceeding, make sure you have a snyk account and activate snyk code.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/secure-development/>Read Moreâ€¦</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/nvim-dev/>Nvim Dev</a></h1><time datetime=2025-03-17T11:27:33+0300 class=post-date>Mon, Mar 17, 2025</time>
Here is a quick list of my Neovim setup for dev work. This includes plugins, LSPs and some handy keymaps.
Plugins Telescope - Fuzzy find files quickly. No need for filetree with this one. Harpoon - Mark frequently visited files and get to them blazingly fast. Mason - This helps in installing language servers. Make sure you have mason-lspconfig.nvim and nvim-lspconfig. nvim-cmp - For completions. Make sure to also get Luasnip, cmp_luasnip, friendly-snippets and nvim-cmp-lsp.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/nvim-dev/>Read Moreâ€¦</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/clearfake/>Clearfake</a></h1><time datetime=2025-03-03T11:10:51+0300 class=post-date>Mon, Mar 3, 2025</time>
A few months ago, I had obtained, through a friend, a sample of clearfake malware that was wrecking havoc in one of his friend&rsquo;s servers.
This post is about analysis I had done, it has been long overdue.
Below is a screenshot of the infection method it uses, a notification to update your browser by running some powershell.
I clicked copy and pasted it in Neovim. This is how it looked<div class=read-more-link><a href=/clearfake/>Read Moreâ€¦</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/purplefox-analysis/>Purplefox Analysis</a></h1><time datetime=2025-02-25T11:03:11+0300 class=post-date>Tue, Feb 25, 2025</time>

A couple of months ago, I came across an intriguing .tmp file that was sent to me. The sender mentioned that their antivirus software had flagged and caught the file on their computer. Naturally, I decided to investigate further. Although the file was labeled as a .tmp file, running it through a file utility revealed that it was actually an MSI (Microsoft Software Installer) file.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/purplefox-analysis/>Read Moreâ€¦</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/about/>About</a></h1><time datetime=2025-02-24T19:35:33+0300 class=post-date>Mon, Feb 24, 2025</time>
Hey, I&rsquo;m Ollieâ€”a cybersecurity pro and dev diving deep into Zig, Lua, and Neovim. I tinker with low-level programming, build custom tooling, and explore malware analysis.
This blog is where I share insights, experiments, and lessons learnedâ€”whether itâ€™s writing an LSP, reverse-engineering binaries, or customizing Neovim for cybersecurity workflows.
If youâ€™re into efficient code, security research, or just making tools work your way, youâ€™re in the right place.
