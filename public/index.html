I had previously written about my cutting up of clearfake which you can find here.
Quick recap:
We deobfuscated the powershell obtained from a fake browser update prompt. The code executed base64 encoded command with window style hidden option. The command downloaded a data.zip file. Now, the zip file is extracted, an exe is sought inside the contents and executed. Here is the code responsible for that: The zip file contains 4 files:<div class=read-more-link><a href=/clearfake-2/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/security-slips/>Security Slips: The Day I Ran Unknown Code</a></h1><time datetime=2025-03-28T13:17:54+0300 class=post-date>Fri, Mar 28, 2025</time>
On March 25th 2025, Troy Hunt, haveibeenpwned&rsquo;s author, published in his blog about how a sneaky phishing lure got hold of his mailing list. This interesting read made me reminisce about how, not so long ago, I almost fell for a similar thing, albeit mine was not so sophisticated.
January 2nd 2025, 12 p.m EAT, I had just gotten home from a lengthy holiday. Being super tired I booted up my Latitude to check on a few things.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/security-slips/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/secure-development/>Secure Development in Neovim using Snyk</a></h1><time datetime=2025-03-19T09:39:27+0300 class=post-date>Wed, Mar 19, 2025</time>
In my previous post I talked about how you can use snyk in your editor as you code and even added snyk-ls as a must have. I had a bit of a tough time finding the correct configuration to achieve this using Neovim. Perhaps you are, right now, on the same path as myself last year. Luckily for you, I gotchu.
Before proceeding, make sure you have a snyk account and activate snyk code.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/secure-development/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/nvim-dev/>Nvim Dev</a></h1><time datetime=2025-03-17T11:27:33+0300 class=post-date>Mon, Mar 17, 2025</time>
Here is a quick list of my Neovim setup for dev work. This includes plugins, LSPs and some handy keymaps.
Plugins Telescope - Fuzzy find files quickly. No need for filetree with this one. Harpoon - Mark frequently visited files and get to them blazingly fast. Mason - This helps in installing language servers. Make sure you have mason-lspconfig.nvim and nvim-lspconfig. nvim-cmp - For completions. Make sure to also get Luasnip, cmp_luasnip, friendly-snippets and nvim-cmp-lsp.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/nvim-dev/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/clearfake/>Clearfake Malware Analysis</a></h1><time datetime=2025-03-03T11:10:51+0300 class=post-date>Mon, Mar 3, 2025</time>
A while ago (around 7 months ago), I had obtained, through a friend, a sample of clearfake malware that was wrecking havoc in one of his friend&rsquo;s servers.
This post is about analysis I had done. I have been procrastinating a lot on writing it, so here it goes&mldr;
Below is a screenshot of the infection method it uses, a notification to update your browser by running some powershell.
I clicked copy and pasted it in Neovim.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/clearfake/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/purplefox-analysis/>Purplefox Analysis</a></h1><time datetime=2025-02-25T11:03:11+0300 class=post-date>Tue, Feb 25, 2025</time>

A couple of months ago, I came across an intriguing .tmp file that was sent to me. The sender mentioned that their antivirus software had flagged and caught the file on their computer. Naturally, I decided to investigate further. Although the file was labeled as a .tmp file, running it through a file utility revealed that it was actually an MSI (Microsoft Software Installer) file.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/purplefox-analysis/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://pop-ecx.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></h1><time datetime=2025-02-24T13:15:42+0300 class=post-date>Mon, Feb 24, 2025</time>
