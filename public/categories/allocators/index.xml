It, however, provides some tools to help avoid some memory safety issues. One of the key tools that help achieve this is the debug allocator. The debug allocator is a special memory allocator that tracks memory allocations and deallocations, helping identify memory leaks and other memory-related issues during development.
Since zig isn&amp;rsquo;t a GC language and does not have a borrow checker, partly due to its design goals, the debug allocator plays a crucial role in helping avoid some memory safety issues.</description></item></channel></rss>
