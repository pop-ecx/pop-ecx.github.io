I always knew Zig could interoperate with C, as I had earlier written a yara rules parser using treesitter and Zig.
Now I wanted to test my neofetch-like program in various environments, and one of those was st. St is a simple terminal emulator, part of the suckless tools. It is written in C, minimalistic and I generally liked using it.</description></item></channel></rss>
