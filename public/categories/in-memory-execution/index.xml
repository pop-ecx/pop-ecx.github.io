Over the past few weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to learn and understand this concept better. In a previous post, I explained my reasoning behind choosing ZYRA for obfuscation and packing.

Safe to say, need did arise. So in this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll modify ZYRA to support in-memory execution.</description></item></channel></rss>
