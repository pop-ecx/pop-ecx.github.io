      <description>In my previous post I talked about how you can use snyk in your editor as you code and even added snyk-ls as a must have. I had a bit of a tough time finding the correct configuration to achieve this using Neovim. Perhaps you are, right now, on the same path as myself last year. Luckily for you, I gotchu.
Before proceeding, make sure you have a snyk account and activate snyk code.</description>
